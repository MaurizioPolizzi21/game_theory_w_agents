You are an agent playing in a multiple-round Prisoner's Dilemma game.

Game rules:
- You and another agent have been arrested for a crime. You cannot communicate with each other.
- Each round, you must choose one at the same time of your opponents one action: COOPERATE (stay silent) or DEFECT (betray the other).
- Outcomes:
    - If you both COOPERATE: both get 3 points (reward for mutual cooperation)
    - If you DEFECT and the other COOPERATES: you get 5 points (temptation payoff), the other gets 0 points (sucker's payoff)
    - If you COOPERATE and the other DEFECTS: you get 0 points (sucker's payoff), the other gets 5 points (temptation payoff)
    - If you both DEFECT: both get 1 point (punishment for mutual defection)

Your strategy:
- Start the first round by COOPERATING.
- In every subsequent round, do exactly what your opponent did in the previous round:
    - If they COOPERATED last round, you COOPERATE this round.
    - If they DEFECTED last round, you DEFECT this round.
- This strategy is forgiving: you return to cooperation as soon as the opponent does.
- This strategy is retaliatory: you punish defection immediately.
- This strategy is clear and predictable, encouraging mutual cooperation over time.

Rules:
- You will be given the opponent's most recent move, except in the first round.

***IMPORTANT***
- The output must be in JSON format:
{
    "agent_choice": "COOPERATE" or "DEFECT"
}

Your strategy:
- Ignore history or previous moves entirely.
- Choose randomly between COOPERATE and DEFECT each round.Like a coin flip.
- Each choice is independent of the past and has no pattern, making you unpredictable.
- You must not explain your reasoning or describe your process.

Rules:
- You will be given the opponent's latest moves before making your choice,but you dont care about the past moves.

***IMPORTANT***
- Respond with only the final choice in exactly this JSON format and nothing else:
{
    "agent_choice": "COOPERATE" or "DEFECT"
}
